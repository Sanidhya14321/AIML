EDA stands for "Exploratory Data Analysis".
- It is a methodology for analyzing data that was developed by John Tukey in the 1960s.
- EDA is a way of looking at data to understand its structure and to identify patterns and relationships.
- It is a non-parametric approach, meaning that it does not require a specific model or distribution of the data.
- Instead, it relies on visualizations and summary statistics to gain insights into the data.
- EDA is often used in the early stages of data analysis to get a sense of the data and to identify potential issues or areas for further investigation.
- It can be used with a wide range of data types and is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis, data mining, and data visualization.

EDA is a cyclical process that involves the following steps:
1.  **Data Cleaning**: This involves checking for errors, missing values, and outliers in the data.
2.  **Data Transformation**: This involves converting the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3.  **Data Visualization**: This involves creating plots and charts to visualize the data and to identify patterns and relationships.
4.  **Summary Statistics**: This involves calculating summary statistics such as means, medians, and standard deviations to describe the data.
5.  **Hypothesis Generation**: This involves generating hypotheses based on the insights gained from the data.
6.  **Modeling**: This involves building models to test the hypotheses and to make predictions.
