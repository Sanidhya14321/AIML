 Probability sampling
 • Every member of the population has an 
equal chance of being selected
 • Examples: – Simple random sampling– Stratified random sampling– Cluster sampling– Systematic sampling
 
 Non-probability sampling
 • Samples are selected on the basis of 
judgment or the convenience of accessing 
data
 • Largely depends on a researcher’s sample 
selection skills
 • Examples:– Convenience sampling– Purposive sampling– Voluntary  response sampling– Snowball sampling

PROBABILITY SAMPLING :

Random Sampling
 Randomly choose a member from the population
 Every member and set of member has an equal chance of being selected.

Systematic Sampling
 Similar to simple random sampling
 Put a member of the population in some order and a starting point is choose as random the every “nth” 
member is selected to be in a sample.

Stratified Sampling
 First divide the population into groups
 Then from each group we select members randomly


NON - PROBABILITY SAMPLING : 

 Convenience sampling
 • Include the respondents/member who are easy to reach for researcher.

 Purposive sampling
 • Select a sample based on the purpose of the research.
 • Researcher select the sample by using their expertise and knowledge.

 Voluntary  Response Sampling
 • Based on the ease of access.
 • Members volunteer themselves instead of researcher selecting the participants and directly contacting them.  

 Snowball Sampling 
• Recruit the participants via research participants for test or study
• Used where it’s hard to find the potential population for research
