# PEP 8 is the style guide for Python code, which provides conventions for writing clean and readable code. Some key points include:
# 1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
# 2. Limit lines to 79 characters.
# 3. Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
# 4. Use descriptive variable and function names.
# 5. Use spaces around operators and after commas.
# 6. Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are needed.
# 7. Use comments to explain code where necessary.
# 8. Use functions to encapsulate code and make it reusable.
# Example of PEP 8 compliant code
# def calculate_area(radius):
#     """Calculate the area of a circle given its radius."""
#     pi = 3.14159
#     return pi * (radius ** 2)
# def main():
#     """Main function to test the calculate_area function."""
#     radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
#     area = calculate_area(radius)
#     print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")
# main()
